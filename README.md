# Synesthesic
are you an artist who loves pinterest and sharing their art? ever struggled with the problem of 15 seconds not being enough when posting an instagram story with music to share your art?

I made every artist's favorite website, pinterest but with the music that every single artist loves to share alongside their art on instagram, best of all it works directly with spotify so it'll scrobble music for any last.fm users logged into spotify and you can also add a timestamp of where to start the song and it'll just keep playing for as long as the viewer wants it to!

so no more of that instagram 15 seconds crap when you know 15 seconds cant fit the song (because it's just too damn good)

## Features
